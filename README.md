# Power-Consumption-Forecasting

## Project Summary

Power Consumption Forecasting Project – A thorough report on the utilization of modern big data methodology based on data analytics and machine learning technology on forecasting consumers’ energy consumption. 
Using such highly relevant data, “PJM Hourly Energy Consumption Data”, this project has a lot of information on electricity consumption for all time scales.
The project encompasses several key stages: they include data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, model development using the advanced XGBoost algorithm, and an in-depth explanation of the outcomes. 
However, it should be able to predict correctly as well as discover trends and patterns that may help in making more effective energy management decisions. 
The report results will be important for producers and governmental authorities because it may contribute to a more sustainable and cost-effective way of using energy.
